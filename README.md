# JourneyToEquality

Our website is an educational, social justice website that aims to inform users about the 2020 Black Lives Matter 
Movement. We have provided a gallery of images from the protest, a short description of the history behind the protests
and what the participants aim to achieve, a petition site, a donation site, and additional educational resources.
